# Readme for the eid-browser-tests repository

The intent of this repository is to contain a number of scripts (shell
scripts, autoit scripts, applescripts) that will automate:

- the installation of the latest development build of the eID middleware
- the installation of the latest development build of popular browsers
  (where available)
- instructing the browsers to go to a test site, and perform a test
  logon with an eID card

it's not quite ready yet, though.
